PID-based one-axis ball balancing robot using Arduino. Uses an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor to stabilize a ball at a target distance. Real-time tuning of Kp, Ki, Kd via Serial. Includes stability detection and automatic neutral reset. The system stabilizes within 30s using empirically tuned parameters.

## Project Summary

This Arduino-based system controls the position of a ball on a beam using **PID control** and real-time feedback from an ultrasonic sensor. The ball is returned to a setpoint by tilting the beam via a servo motor, compensating for positional error.

---

## How It Works

1. **Sensing**: Ball position is measured using HC-SR04.
2. **Filtering**: Distance values are filtered (moving average).
3. **Error Calculation**: `error = distance - setpoint`
4. **PID Control**:
   - **P**: Immediate reaction to error
   - **I**: Compensates for past errors
   - **D**: Predicts upcoming trends
5. **Servo Adjustment**: Beam angle is changed proportionally to the PID output.
6. **Stability Monitoring**: If error stays < 3 cm for 2.5 seconds, servo resets to neutral.

---

## Control Strategy
Implemented a classic PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) loop:
Error = Desired Position - Actual Position

PID Output = Kp * Error + Ki * ‚à´Error + Kd * (dError/dt)
Kp = 5, Ki = 0.01, Kd = 9

Tuned manually and iteratively for minimal overshoot and fast response.

```cpp
error = distance - setpoint;
integral += error;
derivative = error - previous_error;
output = -(Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative);
servoAngle = constrain(neutralAngle + output * 1.2, 0, 180);
myServo.write(servoAngle);
```

PID gains can be tuned in real-time via Serial commands.
System resets if ball goes out of range or stabilizes.
Neutral angle adjustment keeps the beam level


## PID Tuning via Serial Monitor
Example commands for real-time tuning:

Kp 5         ‚Üí Set proportional gain  
Ki 0.01      ‚Üí Set integral gain  
Kd 9         ‚Üí Set derivative gain  
neutral 34   ‚Üí Set neutral servo angle  
servo -20    ‚Üí Move servo from neutral
