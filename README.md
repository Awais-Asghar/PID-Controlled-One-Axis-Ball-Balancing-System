# PID-Controlled-One-Axis-Ball-Balancing-System
PID-based one-axis ball balancing robot using Arduino. Uses an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor to stabilize a ball at a target distance. Real-time tuning of Kp, Ki, Kd via Serial. Includes stability detection and automatic neutral reset. The system stabilizes within 30s using empirically tuned parameters.
